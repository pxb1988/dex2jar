Tools to work with android .dex and java .class files

1. dex-reader/writer:
    Read/write the Dalvik Executable (.dex) file. It has a [light weight API similar with ASM](https://sourceforge.net/p/dex2jar/wiki/Faq#markdown-header-want-to-read-dex-file-using-dex2jar).
2. d2j-dex2jar:
    Convert .dex file to .class files (zipped as jar)
3. smali/baksmali:
    disassemble dex to smali files and assemble dex from smali files. different implementation to [smali/baksmali](http://code.google.com/p/smali), same syntax, but we support escape in type desc "Lcom/dex2jar\t\u1234;"
4. other tools:
    [d2j-decrypt-string](https://sourceforge.net/p/dex2jar/wiki/DecryptStrings)

## Usage

1. In the root directory run: ./gradlew distZip
2. cd dex-tools/build/distributions
3. Unzip the file dex-tools-2.1-SNAPSHOT.zip (file size should be ~5 MB)
4. Run d2j-dex2jar.sh from the unzipped directory

### Example usage:
> sh d2j-dex2jar.sh -f ~/path/to/apk_to_decompile.apk

And the output file will be `apk_to_decompile-dex2jar.jar`.
