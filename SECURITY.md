# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This fork does not release jars with proper semantic versioning as there
are not many breaking changes (if any) between the releases.

For this reason, only the latest version is supported, and if there are
issues, they should also be tested with this version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send me an email: nico.mexis@kabelmail.de

I will try to respond to you as soon as possible (sometimes, it could
take some days, but I *will* contact you back; I have university and
am maintaining this fork in my free time).
